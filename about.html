      <h1> About </h1>
      <p> Hi, Iâ€™m Ben. As of writing this I've been programming for around 3 years in a variety of languages including Python, C++ and C#. 
          I studied Computer Science for A Level and have a place at <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/G611/games-technology"> Bristol University </a> in September to study Games Development. </p>
      <p> Meanwhile I've been building up my skills learning Unity and have so far created three games and am working on a fourth. My first large project, <a target="_blank" href="stickBattleProject.html"> Stick Battle </a> 
          is a Stick Fight clone. It's a multiplayer 2D arena fighter with six maps, powerups and a bunch of weapons. The second, <a target="_blank" href="neonDawnProject.html"> Neon Dawn</a>, was my first experience in the 3D world. 
          It's a runner game where you grapple, wall run and shoot your way through a neon city. I'm happy with the code for this project, but while developing it I found out I'm really not very good at level design, 
          so it's currently in a state where everything is working - but there's nothing to do. My third game was for my first ever game jam. <a target="_blank" href="TheHypnotistAndTheDiamondRoseProject.html"> The Hypnotist and the Diamond Rose</a>. You play as a criminal with the 
          ability to, well, hypnotise people and you have to - you guessed it - steal the Diamond Rose. I learned a lot creating my first three games and you can find out more by clicking the relevant hyperlink or by visiting the 
          Projects page. I'm currently working on my fourth project (a survival game) which I aim to be at least somewhat original and release worthy. </p>
      <p> Outside of Visual Studio I also enjoy designing and playing games, some of my all time favorites being Terraria, Subnautica and Minecraft. Prior to covid I was a competitive swimmer, but now enjoy running and am looking forward
	  to entering some competitions once they start back up. I like reading and often listen to audiobooks while I work. I'm currently listening to The Dark Forest by Liu Cixin. </p>
      <p> I would be interested in freelance or part time work over the summer or a role that can be done in parallel to my studies from autumn. As mentioned above I know a variety of languages though am definitely most confident 
          in C# and the majority of my knowledge is centered around the Unity engine, though I am looking to expand that hence learning C++, the backbone of game development. </p>
